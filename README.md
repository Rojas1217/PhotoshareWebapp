# Photoshare
Website for users to upload images, organize albums, comment and tag pictures, and look for other users; the idea is a bit of a mash of instagram and flickr. Still a work in progress. 

## How was it made?

Written mainly in Python and using the Flask framework as it made it convenient to change HTML pages as well as manage a MySQL database.
